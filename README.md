# FinScore
A prototype AI model for alternative credit scoring in West Africa using simulated data

## The Problem
Over 60% of small businesses in West Africa lack access to formal credit. Traditional banks cannot assess their risk because they lack conventional banking history.

## The Vision
FinScore aims to leverage alternative data (mobile money transactions, telco data) to build an AI-powered creditworthiness score for the informal economy.

## About This Repository
This is a **working prototype and learning sandbox**. It represents my hands-on journey to technical proficiency as I build towards solving this problem. The work here is foundational and evolves as I learn.

### Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains simulated mobile money transaction data.
- `notebooks/`:
  - `01_data_simulation.ipynb`: Data generation and exploratory analysis.
  - `02_feature_engineering.ipynb`: Creating meaningful features from raw data.
  - `03_model_prototype.ipynb`: A simple ML model proof-of-concept.

## Next Steps & Learning Goals
- [ ] Experiment with more advanced models (e.g., Gradient Boosting).
- [ ] Integrate more data sources (simulated telco top-up patterns).
- [ ] Build a simple Streamlit demo app.
